## **1\. Introduction**

### **1.1 Purpose**

This Test Plan outlines the strategy, scope, resources, and schedule for testing the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) of the Grimoire™ (grimOS) platform. The primary goal is to ensure that the MVP meets the specified functional and non-functional requirements, is of high quality, and provides a stable foundation for future development and for the Private Beta program.

### **1.2 Scope of Testing (MVP)**

This Test Plan covers the testing of all core MVP functionalities for the Security, Operations, and Cognitive Core modules, as defined in the "grimOS \- MVP Core Module Feature Specifications." This includes:

* **Security Module MVP:** Basic Threat Intelligence Aggregation & Display, Foundational UBA (Login Anomalies).  
* **Operations Module MVP:** Basic Workflow Automation Engine & RuneForge POC, Basic Data Integration Service (1-2 connectors).  
* **Cognitive Core MVP:** Basic AI Engine for Data Analysis (Simple Pattern Detection), Initial AI Agent Management Stubs & Basic Agent Task Rune, ScrollWeaver POC.  
* **Platform Foundations:** Universal API Fabric (MVP endpoints), Data Management (PostgreSQL, Redis, ChromaDB), Initial UI/UX (Next.js, shadcn/ui, Digital Weave palette with Glassmorphism), basic multi-tenancy aspects, and core security of the platform itself.

**Out of Scope for MVP Testing (will be covered in later phases):**

* Full-scale performance, load, and stress testing.  
* Advanced security penetration testing (beyond basic vulnerability scans).  
* Comprehensive testing of all planned connectors and AI agent capabilities.  
* Full testing of industry-specific modules.

### **2.1 Testing Objectives (MVP)**

* **TO-01:** Verify that all specified MVP functional requirements are implemented correctly.  
* **TO-02:** Ensure that the Universal API Fabric (MVP endpoints) functions as specified.  
* **TO-03:** Validate that the UI/UX for MVP features is intuitive, aligns with the design specifications (including glassmorphism), and meets basic accessibility standards (WCAG 2.1 AA).  
* **TO-04:** Confirm that core platform security measures (authentication, basic authorization, data handling) are in place and functioning.  
* **TO-05:** Identify and report defects in a timely manner.  
* **TO-06:** Ensure the MVP is stable enough for the Private Beta release.  
* **TO-07:** Validate basic data integrity for MVP features.  
* **TO-08:** Assess the usability of MVP features with a small group of internal or early adopter users.

### **2.2 Test Approach**

A risk-based testing approach will be adopted, prioritizing test cases based on criticality and impact. Testing will be conducted in parallel with development sprints (Agile methodology). Both manual and automated testing techniques will be employed. Continuous integration and continuous testing will be integral to the CI/CD pipeline.

### **2.3 Test Levels**

#### **2.3.1 Unit Testing**

* **Responsibility:** Developers.  
* **Scope:** Individual components, functions, and classes within each microservice and the frontend application.  
* **Goal:** Verify that each unit of code performs as designed.  
* **Tools:** Jest/Vitest/Playwright (Frontend), PyTest (Python Backend).  
* **Target:** High code coverage (e.g., \>80%).

#### **2.3.2 Integration Testing**

* **Responsibility:** Developers & QA Engineers.  
* **Scope:** Interactions between microservices, API integrations (internal and with external stubs/mocks), UI to backend API communication, and data flow between components.  
* **Goal:** Identify issues in the interfaces and interactions between integrated components.  
* **Tools:** PyTest, Postman/Newman (for API testing), potentially specialized integration testing frameworks.

#### **2.3.3 System Testing**

* **Responsibility:** QA Engineers.  
* **Scope:** End-to-end testing of the integrated grimOS MVP platform as a whole, based on user stories and functional requirements.  
* **Goal:** Verify that the complete system meets the specified requirements and functions correctly in a production-like environment.  
* **Includes:** Functional testing, UI/UX testing, basic security checks, basic performance checks.

#### **2.3.4 User Acceptance Testing (UAT) \- Private Beta**

* **Responsibility:** Product Management, select early adopters/strategic partners, internal stakeholders.  
* **Scope:** Real-world usage scenarios by representative users in their own (or simulated) environments.  
* **Goal:** Validate that grimOS MVP is acceptable to the target users and meets their business needs. Gather feedback for further refinement.  
* **Environment:** Staging or a dedicated Private Beta environment.

### **2.4 Types of Testing (MVP Focus)**

#### **2.4.1 Functional Testing**

* **Objective:** Verify that all MVP features behave as specified in the DRS and MVP Feature Specifications.  
* **Techniques:** Test case execution based on requirements, user stories, and use cases. Includes positive and negative testing, boundary value analysis.

#### **2.4.2 API Testing**

* **Objective:** Verify that all MVP API endpoints (Universal API Fabric) function correctly according to the API Design Specification.  
* **Techniques:** Using tools like Postman/Newman to test request/response schemas, HTTP status codes, authentication, authorization, error handling, and basic data validation.

#### **2.4.3 UI/UX Testing (including Accessibility \- WCAG 2.1 AA)**

* **Objective:** Ensure the user interface is intuitive, aligns with the "Digital Weave" and glassmorphism design, is easy to navigate, and meets WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards.  
* **Techniques:** Manual exploratory testing, checklist-based testing against UI/UX specifications, cross-browser testing (latest versions of Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari), accessibility testing tools (e.g., Axe, Lighthouse), and manual accessibility checks.

* **Objective:** Identify common security vulnerabilities in the MVP.  
* **Techniques:**  
  * Authentication and Authorization testing (verifying RBAC for MVP roles).  
  * Session management testing.  
  * Basic input validation testing for common vulnerabilities (e.g., simple XSS, SQLi checks \- though frameworks should mitigate many).  
  * Checking for secure API key handling (for external AI model integrations).  
  * Running automated vulnerability scanners (SAST/DAST tools integrated into CI/CD, dependency checkers).  
  * Review of security configurations (cloud, K8s).  
* *Note: Full penetration testing is planned for post-MVP, pre-GA phases.*

#### **2.4.5 Basic Performance Testing**

* **Objective:** Ensure key MVP functionalities perform within acceptable response times under expected (low to moderate) load.  
* **Techniques:**  
  * Response time measurement for critical API endpoints and UI interactions.  
  * Basic load testing on a few critical user flows (e.g., login, dashboard load, simple workflow execution) to identify major bottlenecks.  
* *Note: Comprehensive load, stress, and soak testing are planned for later phases.*

#### **2.4.6 Usability Testing (with early adopters)**

* **Objective:** Gather qualitative feedback on the ease of use, intuitiveness, and overall user experience of the MVP.  
* **Techniques:** Moderated or unmoderated usability testing sessions with a small group of representative users (internal or Private Beta participants). Task-based scenarios, think-aloud protocol.

### **2.5 Test Automation Strategy**

* **Unit Tests:** Fully automated and integrated into the CI pipeline.  
* **Integration Tests:** Key integration points and API contract tests will be automated.  
* **API Tests:** A significant portion of API tests (functional, security) will be automated using tools like Postman/Newman and integrated into CI/CD.  
* **E2E UI Tests (Selective for MVP):** Automate a few critical end-to-end user scenarios for regression testing using tools like Playwright or Cypress. Full E2E automation will be built out incrementally.  
* **Goal:** Achieve a balanced automation pyramid with a strong base of unit tests, a good layer of API/integration tests, and selective UI E2E tests.

## **3\. Test Environment & Tools**

### **3.1 Test Environments**

* **Development (DEV):** Used by developers for unit testing and local development. May include local K8s clusters (Minikube, Kind).
