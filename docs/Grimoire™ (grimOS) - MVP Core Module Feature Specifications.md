# **Grimoire™ (grimOS) \- MVP Core Module Feature Specifications**

Version: 1.0  
Date: May 15, 2025  
**1\. Introduction**

This document details the core Minimum Viable Product (MVP) functionalities for the Security, Operations, and Cognitive Core modules of Grimoire™ (grimOS). These specifications are derived from the "Detailed Requirements Specification (DRS)", "Grimoire™ (grimOS) Comprehensive Blueprint", and "grimOS Development Blueprint". The focus is on delivering foundational capabilities for the Phase 1 (Core Foundation & MVP) release.

**2\. Core Principles for MVP Development**

* **Focus on Core Value:** Deliver tangible value to early adopters in key areas.  
* **Validate Assumptions:** Use the MVP to test core architectural and product hypotheses.  
* **Iterative Approach:** Build foundational elements that can be expanded upon in subsequent phases.  
* **Security First:** Ensure all MVP components are built with security by design.  
* **API-Driven:** Expose functionalities via the Universal API Fabric from the start.

**3\. Security Module \- MVP Functionalities**

As per the Development Plan (3.1.2) and Comprehensive Blueprint (V.A.1), the Security Module MVP will focus on Threat Intelligence (basic aggregation) and User Behavior Analytics (foundational).

**3.1 MVP Feature: Basic Threat Intelligence Aggregation & Display**

* **Description:** This feature will provide the capability to ingest threat intelligence feeds from a limited set of predefined open-source or partner sources. The aggregated intelligence will be processed, deduplicated at a basic level, and displayed in a dedicated section of the grimOS UI. The focus is on providing initial visibility into potential threats.  
* **Key Functional Requirements (DRS References):**  
  * FR-SEC-001 (Threat Intelligence \- basic ingestion and display)  
  * FR-OD-001 (Functional Dashboards \- a simple dashboard for displaying threat intel)  
  * FR-API-001, FR-API-002 (APIs for potential internal access to this data)  
* **Core User Stories (Examples):**  
  * As a Security Analyst, I want to view a consolidated list of recent threat indicators from configured feeds so that I can be aware of potential emerging threats.  
  * As an Administrator, I want to configure predefined threat intelligence feed sources (e.g., via API key or URL for 1-2 open-source feeds) so that the system can ingest relevant data.  
* **Acceptance Criteria (High-Level Examples):**  
  * System can successfully ingest data from at least two pre-configured open-source threat intelligence feeds (e.g., STIX/TAXII feeds).  
  * Ingested threat indicators (e.g., malicious IPs, domains, hashes) are displayed in a dedicated UI view.  
  * Basic deduplication of indicators from the same source is performed.  
  * The display includes essential information like indicator type, source, and timestamp.  
* **Key Technical Considerations/Dependencies:**  
  * Define data model for threat indicators.  
  * Develop parsers for selected feed formats (e.g., STIX, CSV).  
  * Backend service for ingestion, storage (PostgreSQL/NoSQL), and API exposure.  
  * Frontend components (Next.js, shadcn/ui) for displaying threat intelligence.  
  * Initial focus on batch ingestion; real-time streaming is a future enhancement.

**3.2 MVP Feature: Foundational User Behavior Analytics (UBA) \- Login Anomalies**

* **Description:** This feature will provide basic UBA by monitoring user login activity within grimOS. It will establish baseline login patterns (e.g., typical times, locations \- if available and consented) and flag anomalous login attempts (e.g., login from a new/unusual geographic location, multiple failed attempts followed by success). Alerts for these anomalies will be generated for administrative review.  
* **Key Functional Requirements (DRS References):**  
  * FR-SEC-002 (User Behavior Analytics \- foundational, focused on login anomalies)  
  * FR-PM-001 (User Authentication \- logs from this are crucial)  
  * FR-GT-002 (Audit Logging \- login events must be logged)  
  * FR-SEC-004 (Incident Response \- basic alerting mechanism for anomalies)  
  * FR-OD-001 (A section in a security dashboard to show UBA alerts)  
* **Core User Stories (Examples):**  
  * As a Security Administrator, I want to be alerted when a user logs in from a significantly different geographical location than usual so that I can investigate potentially compromised accounts.  
  * As a Security Administrator, I want to see a list of anomalous login events (e.g., impossible travel, brute-force attempts) for review.  
* **Acceptance Criteria (High-Level Examples):**  
  * System logs all user login attempts (success and failure) with relevant metadata (timestamp, IP address, user agent).  
  * A baseline for "normal" login behavior is established per user over a defined period (e.g., based on IP geolocation).  
  * Anomalous login events (e.g., login from a new country, \>X failed attempts in Y minutes) trigger an internal alert.  
  * Alerts are viewable by administrators in a dedicated UI section.  
* **Key Technical Considerations/Dependencies:**  
  * Reliable IP geolocation service integration.  
  * Algorithm for establishing baseline behavior and detecting deviations (initially rule-based, can evolve to ML).  
  * Secure storage of login event data and user baselines.  
  * Alerting mechanism (e.g., internal notification system, email for MVP).  
  * Privacy considerations for location data must be addressed (consent, anonymization where appropriate).

**4\. Operations Module \- MVP Functionalities**

As per the Development Plan (3.1.2) and Comprehensive Blueprint (V.A.1), the Operations Module MVP will focus on Workflow Automation (basic capabilities) and Data Integration (1-2 key connectors).

**4.1 MVP Feature: Basic Workflow Automation Engine & Visual Designer (RuneForge POC)**

* **Description:** This feature will provide the foundational elements of the workflow automation engine. It will include a Proof of Concept (POC) for the RuneForge visual designer, allowing users to create simple, linear workflows using a limited set of basic "Runes" (e.g., Start, End, Manual Task, Simple Condition, Basic API Call). The engine will be able to execute these simple workflows.  
* **Key Functional Requirements (DRS References):**  
  * FR-OPS-001 (Workflow Automation Engine \- basic execution)  
  * FR-CR-001 (Visual Workflow Designer \- RuneForge POC with limited Runes)  
  * FR-CR-002 (Pre-built Logic Blocks \- MVP set: Start, End, Manual Task, Simple If/Else, Basic API Call Rune)  
  * FR-CR-003, FR-CR-006 (Specific Rune types for MVP)  
  * FR-CR-009 (Workflow Version Control \- basic storage of versions)  
  * FR-OD-005 (SigilSight \- basic logging of workflow execution)  
* **Core User Stories (Examples):**  
  * As an Operations Analyst, I want to use a visual tool to define a simple sequential workflow with a manual approval step so that I can standardize a basic process.  
  * As a System, I want to execute a defined workflow instance step-by-step based on its definition.  
  * As an Operations Analyst, I want to view the status (e.g., running, completed, failed) of my workflow instances.  
* **Acceptance Criteria (High-Level Examples):**  
  * Users can create a workflow with at least 3-4 steps using the RuneForge POC (e.g., Start \-\> Manual Task \-\> End).  
  * The workflow engine can execute the defined workflow instance.  
  * Manual tasks can be assigned to a user/role and marked as complete via the UI.  
  * A basic API Call Rune can successfully make a GET request to a predefined public API.  
  * Workflow definitions are saved and can be retrieved. Basic execution logs are generated.  
* **Key Technical Considerations/Dependencies:**  
  * Define data model for workflow definitions and instances (PostgreSQL).  
  * Develop backend services for workflow definition, execution, and state management (Python, potentially using a state machine library).  
  * Frontend components for RuneForge POC (Next.js, React, shadcn/ui, a simple canvas/drag-drop library).  
  * Limited set of initial Runes; focus on core execution logic.  
  * No complex branching, looping, or parallel execution in MVP.

**4.2 MVP Feature: Basic Data Integration Service (1-2 Key Connectors)**

* **Description:** This feature will establish the foundation of the Data Integration Service within the Interoperability Engine. It will include the development of 1-2 pre-built connectors for widely used SaaS applications (e.g., a generic REST API connector, or a connector for a popular service like Slack for notifications, or a simple GSheet connector for data input/output). This will primarily be used by the Workflow Automation Engine's API Call Rune.  
* **Key Functional Requirements (DRS References):**  
  * FR-OPS-002 (Data Integration Service \- foundational)  
  * FR-IE-001 (Built-in iPaaS Layer \- conceptual foundation)  
  * FR-IE-002 (Pre-built Connectors \- 1-2 for MVP)  
  * FR-IE-006 (Example: Slack connector for notifications from a workflow) OR a generic outbound REST API call capability.  
* **Core User Stories (Examples):**  
  * As a Workflow Designer, I want to configure a workflow step to send a notification to a Slack channel upon task completion so that stakeholders are informed.  
  * As a Workflow Designer, I want to configure a workflow step to make a GET request to an external system's REST API and use its response data in a subsequent step (simple use case).  
* **Acceptance Criteria (High-Level Examples):**  
  * A workflow can successfully send a message to a configured Slack channel via a dedicated "Slack Notification" Rune.  
  * A workflow can successfully execute a GET request using the "Basic API Call" Rune to a specified public REST API and log the response status.  
  * Secure management of credentials (e.g., API keys, tokens) for these connectors (using environment variables or a simple secrets management approach for MVP).  
* **Key Technical Considerations/Dependencies:**  
  * Backend service for managing connector configurations and executing calls.  
  * Standardized interface for Runes to interact with connectors.  
  * Focus on outbound data/actions for MVP. Inbound data ingestion is more complex and for a later phase.  
  * Error handling for external API calls.

**5\. Cognitive Core \- MVP Functionalities**

As per the Development Plan (3.1.2) and Comprehensive Blueprint (V.A.1), the Cognitive Core MVP will focus on basic AI for data analysis, initial agent management stubs, and a POC for ScrollWeaver (natural language workflow generation).

**5.1 MVP Feature: Basic AI Engine for Data Analysis (Simple Pattern Detection)**

* **Description:** This feature will introduce a very basic AI capability. It will involve analyzing a specific type of operational data (e.g., workflow execution times, or security login events from FR-SEC-002) to identify simple patterns or anomalies. For instance, it could identify workflows that consistently take longer than average or detect a sudden spike in failed login attempts. The output will be a simple notification or flag within a relevant dashboard.  
* **Key Functional Requirements (DRS References):**  
  * FR-CC-004 (Anomaly Detection \- very basic, rule-based or simple statistical for MVP on a specific dataset)  
  * FR-CC-005 (Predictive Insights \- very basic, e.g., "X is trending upwards")  
  * FR-PM-008 (Long-Term Memory \- foundational storage for data to be analyzed, e.g., in PostgreSQL or Data Lake stub)  
* **Core User Stories (Examples):**  
  * As an Operations Manager, I want to be notified if a specific workflow type's average completion time increases by more than X% over a week so I can investigate potential bottlenecks.  
  * As a Security Admin, I want to see a flag if the number of failed login attempts across the system exceeds a predefined threshold in an hour.  
* **Acceptance Criteria (High-Level Examples):**  
  * The system can analyze historical workflow completion times (from MVP workflows) and flag instances that are \>2 standard deviations above the mean.  
  * The system can analyze login attempt logs and generate an alert if failed logins exceed 50 in one hour.  
  * These simple analytical results are displayed on a relevant MVP dashboard.  
* **Key Technical Considerations/Dependencies:**  
  * Requires data to be logged from other MVP features (workflows, logins).  
  * Simple statistical methods or rule-based logic for MVP (Python backend with libraries like Pandas, NumPy).  
  * No complex ML model training in this MVP feature; focus on foundational data processing and basic analytics.  
  * Data will be pulled from PostgreSQL or a simple log aggregation mechanism.

**5.2 MVP Feature: Initial AI Agent Management Stubs & Basic Agent Task Rune**

* **Description:** This feature will lay the groundwork for AI agent integration. It will involve creating backend stubs for agent registration and management (no actual autonomous agent execution in MVP). A very basic "Agent Task" Rune will be added to RuneForge, which, for MVP, might simply log a message like "Task assigned to Agent X" or call a dummy internal API endpoint representing an agent.  
* **Key Functional Requirements (DRS References):**  
  * FR-CC-001 (Agent Orchestration \- stubs for future capabilities, no actual orchestration)  
  * FR-CC-011, FR-CC-012, FR-CC-013 (Agent Management \- very basic internal registration/listing, no UI for user creation in MVP)  
  * FR-CR-007 (Rune Type \- Agent Task: a simplified version for MVP)  
* **Core User Stories (Examples):**  
  * As a System Developer, I want to register a conceptual AI agent in the backend so that it can be referenced by a workflow.  
  * As a Workflow Designer (using RuneForge POC), I want to add an "Assign to Agent" step in my workflow, which for MVP, logs the assignment.  
* **Acceptance Criteria (High-Level Examples):**  
  * Backend API endpoints exist for conceptually registering/listing "agents" (internal, no UI).  
  * A new "Agent Task" Rune is available in RuneForge POC.  
  * When a workflow executes an "Agent Task" Rune, it successfully logs a predefined message including a conceptual agent ID.  
* **Key Technical Considerations/Dependencies:**  
  * Define a basic data model for "agent" registration (PostgreSQL).  
  * This is primarily about creating placeholders and foundational API contracts for future, more complex agent integration (LangGraph, SuperAGI etc. are for later phases).  
  * No actual AI agent logic or execution is part of this MVP feature.

**5.3 MVP Feature: ScrollWeaver POC (Natural Language to Simple Workflow Stub)**

* **Description:** This feature will be a Proof of Concept for ScrollWeaver, the natural language workflow generator. Users will be able to type a very simple instruction (e.g., "Create a task for John Doe to review the Q1 report and then notify Sarah Connor"). For MVP, the system will parse this simple instruction using basic NLP (keyword spotting, simple grammar) and generate a *stub* or a textual representation of the corresponding simple linear workflow (e.g., "Step 1: Manual Task 'Review Q1 Report' assigned to John Doe. Step 2: Notification Task 'Inform Sarah Connor'"). No actual workflow execution or RuneForge generation from this in MVP.  
* **Key Functional Requirements (DRS References):**  
  * FR-CC-003 (Natural Language Workflow Creation \- ScrollWeaver POC, output is textual representation)  
  * FR-COS-001 (Natural Language Interface \- basic input field for ScrollWeaver POC)  
* **Core User Stories (Examples):**  
  * As an Operations User, I want to type "assign 'approve budget' to finance\_team then send 'budget approved' to manager\_x" and see a textual outline of these steps.  
* **Acceptance Criteria (High-Level Examples):**  
  * User can input a simple, predefined natural language command for a 2-3 step linear process.  
  * The system can parse the command and identify key actions (e.g., "assign task," "notify") and entities (e.g., user names, task descriptions).  
  * The system outputs a textual, step-by-step representation of the interpreted workflow.  
  * Handles a very limited vocabulary and sentence structure for MVP.  
* **Key Technical Considerations/Dependencies:**  
  * Basic NLP techniques (e.g., using Python libraries like spaCy or NLTK for tokenization, entity recognition on a very constrained grammar).  
  * No complex LLM integration for this POC; focus on rule-based parsing or simple pattern matching.  
  * The output is a textual description, not a directly executable workflow or RuneForge diagram in this MVP. This validates the concept before investing in complex generation.  
  * UI will be a simple input field and text display area.

This MVP scope aims to deliver a foundational, working subset of grimOS's core capabilities, providing a platform for gathering early feedback and guiding future development iterations.
