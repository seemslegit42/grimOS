## **1\. Introduction**

### **1.1 Purpose**

This Deployment Plan outlines the strategy, procedures, and infrastructure considerations for deploying the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) of the Grimoire™ (grimOS) platform. It aims to ensure a smooth, secure, and reliable deployment process across all necessary environments, culminating in the Private Beta release.

### **1.2 Scope (MVP)**

This plan covers the deployment of all core MVP functionalities for the Security, Operations, and Cognitive Core modules, along with the foundational platform components (Universal API Fabric, Data Management, UI) to Development, QA, Staging, and Production (Private Beta) environments. It includes infrastructure setup, CI/CD pipeline design, deployment procedures, and initial monitoring/maintenance strategies for the MVP phase.

## **2\. Deployment Strategy**

### **2.1 Overall Approach**

The deployment strategy will be automated, repeatable, and version-controlled, leveraging Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and a robust CI/CD pipeline. A cloud-native approach will be adopted, utilizing containerization (Docker) and orchestration (Kubernetes) for scalability and resilience. The deployment will be progressive, moving through defined environments with rigorous testing at each stage.

### **2.2 Deployment Goals (MVP)**

* **DPG-01:** Successfully deploy a stable and functional grimOS MVP to the Production environment for Private Beta users.  
* **DPG-02:** Establish automated and reliable CI/CD pipelines for building, testing, and deploying grimOS components.  
* **DPG-03:** Ensure consistent and reproducible environments using IaC.  
* **DPG-04:** Implement foundational monitoring and logging for the MVP in production.  
* **DPG-05:** Define and test rollback procedures for MVP deployments.  
* **DPG-06:** Ensure all MVP deployments adhere to the security requirements outlined in the Security Design Document.

### **2.3 Phased Rollout to Environments**

1. **Development (DEV):** Continuous deployment from feature branches or main development branch for developer testing and integration.  
2. **Testing/QA (QA):** Automated deployment of stable builds from the main development or release candidate branch for QA testing cycles.  
3. **Staging (UAT/Pre-PROD):** Manual or triggered deployment of release candidates for UAT by Private Beta users and final pre-production validation. This environment will closely mirror Production.  
4. **Production (PROD \- Private Beta):** Controlled, scheduled deployment of validated release candidates for the Private Beta program.

## **3\. Environment Specification**

### **3.1 Development Environment (DEV)**

* **Purpose:** Developer sandboxes, unit testing, initial integration testing.  
* **Infrastructure:** Local K8s clusters (Minikube, Kind, Docker Desktop K8s) or a shared, lightweight cloud-based K8s cluster.  
* **Data:** Mock data, sample data, or anonymized subsets.  
* **Deployment:** Frequent, automated deployments from feature branches.

### **3.2 Testing/QA Environment (QA)**

* **Purpose:** Comprehensive integration testing, system testing, API testing, UI/UX testing, basic security and performance testing by the QA team.  
* **Infrastructure:** Dedicated cloud-based K8s cluster, closer in configuration to Staging/Production but potentially smaller scale.  
* **Data:** Seeded test data, anonymized data sets designed to cover various test scenarios.  
* **Deployment:** Automated deployments from a stable development branch or release candidate branch after successful CI builds and unit/integration tests.

### **3.3 Staging Environment (UAT/Pre-PROD)**

* **Purpose:** User Acceptance Testing (UAT) by Private Beta users, final validation before production deployment, performance soak testing (basic for MVP).  
* **Infrastructure:** Cloud-based K8s cluster closely mirroring the Production environment in terms of configuration, services, and data (anonymized copy of production-like data or high-quality seeded data).  
* **Data:** Anonymized production-like data or extensive seeded data.  
* **Deployment:** Manual trigger or scheduled deployment of release candidates that have passed QA.

### **3.4 Production Environment (PROD \- for Private Beta)**

* **Purpose:** Host the live grimOS MVP for Private Beta users.  
* **Infrastructure:** Highly available, scalable, and secure cloud-based K8s cluster with production-grade configurations for all services (databases, Kafka, API Gateway, etc.). Multi-AZ deployment for critical components.  
* **Data:** Live Private Beta user data.  
* **Deployment:** Controlled, scheduled deployments of thoroughly tested and UAT-approved release candidates. Blue/Green or Canary deployment strategies will be considered for future phases (MVP might use a simpler rolling update or recreate strategy with planned downtime if necessary).

### **3.5 Environment Parity**

Efforts will be made to maintain parity between Staging and Production environments in terms of software versions, configurations (managed by IaC), and infrastructure setup to minimize environment-specific issues. QA environment will also aim for high parity.

## **4\. Infrastructure Requirements (MVP)**

(Ref: SAD Section 8.1, 8.2; DRS Section 6.2)

### **4.1 Cloud Provider Selection (Conceptual)**

* A major cloud provider (AWS, Azure, or GCP) will be selected based on criteria such as service offerings (managed Kubernetes, databases, AI services), cost, scalability, security features, and team familiarity. For this plan, we assume a generic cloud provider.

### **4.2 Compute Resources (Kubernetes Cluster)**

* **Managed Kubernetes Service:** (e.g., EKS, AKS, GKE) for orchestrating Docker containers.  
* **Node Pools:** Configured with appropriate instance types for different workloads (general purpose, compute-optimized for AI services if needed for MVP).  
* **Autoscaling:** Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) and Cluster Autoscaler configured for relevant deployments and node pools.

### **4.3 Database Services**

* **Managed PostgreSQL:** For relational data. Configured for high availability (e.g., multi-AZ).  
* **Managed Redis:** For caching and session management.  
* **Vector Database:**  
  * **ChromaDB (MVP Local/DEV):** Can be run as a container within K8s for initial phases.  
  * **Scaled Option (Future):** Managed Redis with vector search, or a dedicated managed vector DB service.  
* **Backup and Restore:** Automated backup solutions for all databases.

### **4.4 Messaging Services (Kafka, Redis)**

* **Managed Apache Kafka:** For event streaming. Configured for high availability and persistence.  
* **Managed Redis:** Can also serve for simpler message queuing tasks if Kafka is overkill for certain MVP internal communications.

### **4.5 Networking (VPC, Subnets, Load Balancers, API Gateway)**

* **Virtual Private Cloud (VPC/VNet):** Secure, isolated network.  
* **Subnets:** Public and private subnets across multiple Availability Zones (AZs).  
* **Load Balancers:** Application Load Balancers (ALBs) or equivalent to distribute traffic to frontend services and the API Gateway.  
* **API Gateway (Kong or Cloud Native):** Deployed in a highly available configuration.  
* **Firewalls/Security Groups/Network ACLs:** To control traffic flow between subnets and to/from the internet.

### **4.6 Storage (Object Storage, Container Registry)**

* **Object Storage (e.g., S3, Azure Blob):** For Data Lake (MVP: basic setup), backups, static assets.  
* **Container Registry (e.g., ECR, ACR, GCR, Docker Hub private):** For storing Docker images.

### **4.7 Monitoring and Logging Infrastructure**

* **Centralized Logging:** (e.g., ELK stack/OpenSearch, or cloud provider solutions like CloudWatch Logs, Azure Monitor Logs).  
* **Metrics Collection:** Prometheus.  
* **Visualization:** Grafana.  
* **Alerting System:** Integrated with monitoring tools (e.g., Alertmanager for Prometheus).

## **5\. CI/CD Pipeline**

(Ref: SAD Section 8.3, Development Blueprint Section 10\)

### **5.1 Pipeline Overview**

A comprehensive CI/CD pipeline will automate the build, test, and deployment of grimOS microservices and frontend applications.

### **5.2 Source Code Management**

* **Git:** Used for version control.  
* **Repository Hosting:** GitHub, GitLab, or similar.  
* **Branching Strategy:** Gitflow or a similar trunk-based development with feature branches. main or master branch for production releases, develop for integration.

### **5.3 Build Process**

* **Frontend (Next.js):** npm install/yarn install, npm run build/yarn build.  
* **Backend (Python):** Dependency management (Poetry/pip), packaging into Docker images.  
* **Containerization:** Dockerfiles for each microservice and frontend application.

### **5.4 Automated Testing Stages**

* **Unit Tests:** Run after every commit to feature branches and before merging to develop.  
* **Integration Tests & API Tests:** Run after deployment to DEV and QA environments.  
* **E2E UI Tests (Selective for MVP):** Run against the QA environment.

### **5.5 Deployment to Environments**

* **IaC:** Terraform (or CloudFormation/ARM templates) used to define and manage infrastructure.  
* **Kubernetes Deployments:** Use K8s manifests (YAML) or Helm charts, managed via tools like ArgoCD (GitOps) or Kustomize for environment-specific configurations.  
* **Secrets Management:** Securely inject secrets into pods (e.g., via HashiCorp Vault integration or K8s secrets encrypted with KMS).

### **5.6 Artifact Management**

* **Container Images:** Stored in a private container registry.  
* **Build Artifacts:** Stored temporarily if needed (e.g., by Jenkins).

## **6\. Deployment Procedures (MVP)**

### **6.1 Pre-Deployment Checklist (for Staging & Production)**

* All automated tests passed in the previous environment.  
* QA sign-off (for Staging deployment).  
* UAT sign-off (for Production deployment).  
* Infrastructure provisioned/updated via IaC.  
* Backup of critical data (for Production).  
* Rollback plan reviewed and ready.  
* Communication plan for stakeholders (and Private Beta users for Production).  
* Necessary approvals obtained.

### **6.2 Deployment Steps (Conceptual for a Microservice)**

1. Fetch the latest approved artifact (Docker image) from the registry.  
2. Update the Kubernetes deployment manifest (e.g., image tag).  
3. Apply the manifest to the target K8s cluster (kubectl apply \-f deployment.yaml or Helm upgrade).  
4. Kubernetes performs a rolling update by default (or other strategy if configured).  
5. Monitor deployment status and pod health.

### **6.3 Post-Deployment Verification**

* **Smoke Tests:** Automated or manual quick tests to verify critical functionalities are working in the new environment.  
* **Health Checks:** Verify all services are reporting healthy status via K8s liveness/readiness probes and application-level health endpoints.  
* **Log Monitoring:** Check logs for any immediate errors or unusual activity.  
* **Key Metric Monitoring:** Observe key performance and business metrics.

### **6.4 Rollback Plan**

* **Automated Rollback (K8s):** Kubernetes rollout undo command can be used to revert to the previous stable deployment revision if issues are detected post-deployment.  
* **Database Rollback:** More complex; typically involves restoring from backup or applying reverse migrations. For MVP, schema changes will be carefully managed to be backward compatible where possible or require planned maintenance.  
* **Decision Criteria for Rollback:** Predefined criteria (e.g., critical smoke test failures, significant increase in error rates, P1 incidents directly attributable to the deployment).

## **7\. Monitoring and Logging Strategy (Initial for MVP)**

### **7.1 Key Metrics to Monitor**

* **Infrastructure Metrics:** CPU, memory, disk, network I/O for K8s nodes and pods.  
* **Application Performance Metrics (APM):** Request latency, error rates, throughput for each microservice and API endpoint.  
* **Database Metrics:** Query performance, connection counts, replication lag.  
* **Kafka Metrics:** Message throughput, consumer lag.  
* **Business Metrics (Basic):** User logins, workflow execution counts (success/failure).

### **7.2 Logging Approach**

* **Structured Logging:** All applications and services will use structured logging (e.g., JSON format).  
* **Centralized Log Aggregation:** Logs shipped to a central platform (ELK/OpenSearch or cloud provider solution).  
* **Log Levels:** Consistent use of log levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR, CRITICAL).  
* **Correlation IDs:** Include correlation IDs in logs to trace requests across multiple services.

### **7.3 Alerting (Basic)**

* Alerts configured for:  
  * Critical infrastructure issues (e.g., high CPU/memory, disk full).  
  * High application error rates.  
  * Service unavailability (failed health checks).  
  * Key security events (from Security Module MVP).  
* **Notification Channels:** Email, Slack for MVP. PagerDuty for critical alerts in later phases.

## **8\. Maintenance and Update Strategy (Initial for MVP)**

### **8.1 Patch Management**

* Regular review and application of security patches for OS, Kubernetes, Docker, and all third-party dependencies.  
* Automated tools for vulnerability scanning will inform patching priorities.

### **8.2 Application Updates**

* Deployed via the CI/CD pipeline as described.  
* Aim for frequent, smaller updates rather than large, infrequent ones to reduce risk.  
* Communication to Private Beta users for any updates involving downtime or significant changes.

### **8.3 Backup and Recovery Procedures**

* Automated daily (or more frequent) backups for all persistent data stores.  
* Backup encryption and secure offsite storage (if applicable).  
* Regularly test data recovery procedures.  
* Documented disaster recovery plan (DRP) will be developed post-MVP.

## **9\. Security Considerations for Deployment**

* **Secure CI/CD Pipeline:** Protect access to the CI/CD system, scan code and artifacts for vulnerabilities.  
* **Secrets Management:** No hardcoded secrets. Use a secure vault or K8s secrets encrypted at rest.  
* **Least Privilege for Deployment Tools:** CI/CD tools should have only the necessary permissions to deploy to target environments.  
* **Environment Isolation:** Strict network and access controls between DEV, QA, Staging, and PROD.  
* **IaC Security:** Regularly scan IaC templates for security misconfigurations.  
* **Post-Deployment Audits:** Review access logs and configurations after deployment.

## **10\. Roles and Responsibilities**

* **DevOps Team/SRE:** Responsible for designing, building, and maintaining the CI/CD pipeline, infrastructure provisioning (IaC), environment management, monitoring, and alerting systems. Leads deployment execution.  
* **Development Team:** Responsible for creating Dockerfiles, K8s manifests (or Helm charts) for their services, ensuring services are deployable and observable, participating in troubleshooting deployment issues.  
* **QA Team:** Responsible for verifying deployments in QA and Staging, running post-deployment smoke tests.  
* **Product Management:** Approving releases for UAT and Production. Communicating with stakeholders/users.  
* **Security Team (or Champion):** Reviewing deployment plans for security implications, auditing deployed environments.

## **11\. Future Considerations**

* **Advanced Deployment Strategies:** Blue/Green deployments, Canary releases for zero-downtime updates and risk reduction.  
* **GitOps:** Managing K8s cluster configuration and application deployments declaratively using Git as the single source of truth (e.g., with ArgoCD, Flux).  
* **Chaos Engineering:** Proactively testing system resilience by injecting failures.  
* **Comprehensive Disaster Recovery Plan & Drills.**  
* **Automated Scaling based on Predictive Analytics.**
